# Brightlayer UI Lab - Angular


The Brightlayer UI Lab is a sandbox environment for adopter teams to contribute back into Brightlayer UI, but with lower barriers to entry.   
In this package, one can expect to see early-access components, services, and other utilities.

All resources available in the Angular Brightlayer UI Lab are distributed in via NPM in the `blui-lab/angular` package.

> Note: The items found within the BLUI Lab are not thoroughly tested nor scrutinized by the Brightlayer UI and are distributed as-is.
